# AoC 2022 in rust
_The solutions are NOT a representative sample of my production code._

I'm having fun and messing around with advanced features of rust and [being clever (in a bad way)](https://github.com/dwmkerr/hacker-laws#kernighans-law). The results are much more difficult to read and write than reasonable, probably slower than simple well-optimized code, and all around too much of an overkill for these problems. Don't yuck my yum.

To launch a solution use `cargo run --bin <day_number>`, ie `cargo run --bin 01`
